# CodeRage Construction Kit

## A starting point for your Next.js / Material UI (MUI) app

For more info, hit up [CodeRage.io](https://www.codrage.io).

Clone this repo to your machine and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. To run the app in dev mmode, run `npm run dev`. To build it, run `npm run build`. And to start the app, run `npm run start`.

I highly recommend [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to run your app in production. It kinda rocks. I use it in production and so should you. Maybe. If you want.

This project is based entirely on the [Next.js example](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs) by [siriwatknp](https://github.com/siriwatknp). Clone a [bunch of examples here](https://github.com/mui/material-ui) if you like.
